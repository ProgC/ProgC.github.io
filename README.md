I'm a programmer with a strong focus on game development, though I enjoy exploring other areas as well.
My specialty lies in bringing ideas to life—whether it’s creating games, building prototypes, developing tools, or crafting complete software solutions.
I'm passionate about designing game engines, systems, and working on electrical projects too.
Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn—if you can find me there!
Thank you!
